# 3DShooter
Simple game made with Unity to follow along with Zenva Academy Course.

So, I really loved to make this Project, it teached me a lot in general terms. I've implemented a lot of stuff on it, things like:
* NavMesh
It's not perfect, I can't implement more than one enemy because the way that I've implemented, they collide with each other. And as I did this do study, I've not tried to fix yet, at least for now...
* Object Pooling
Great functionality to implement, it helps a lot in terms of performance, and besides being a very small project it's always great to know how to boost game performance.
* UI 
The UI is very poor but I learned a lot of new concepts on this topic.
* Scripts Abstractions
I also tried my best to make the code cleaner and very abstract, passing values as references and other things. Of course, I'm very new at Unity yet but I'm always trying to improve my scripts.

There's a few more things that I've made but it's nothing really different from my other projects.
